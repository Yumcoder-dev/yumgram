It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words _italic_ with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)

# This is an <h1> tag

## This is an <h2> tag

###### This is an <h6> tag

_This text will be italic_
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
**This will also be bold**

_You **can** combine them_

- Item 1
- Item 2

  - Item 2a
  - Item 2b

1. Item 1
1. Item 2
1. Item 3
   1. Item 3a
   1. Item 3b

As Kanye West said:

I think you should use an
`<addr>` element here instead.
